# Max Mustermann

I am a predoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Environmental Systems Sciences](https://ess.uni-graz.at/en/) where I study critical transitions in nature and society. 

I am also part of the field of excellence Complexity of Life in Basic Research and Innovation [COLIBRI](https://colibri.uni-graz.at/en/) which investigates complex systems and prepares for future changes in the biosphere and sociosphere by understanding the complexity and interactions between components of living systems.
